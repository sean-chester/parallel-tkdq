------------------------------------
### Introduction
<a name="introduction" ></a>

This ParallelTKDQ software implements several alternative algorithms 
for computing top-k dominating queries with multi-core parallelism. 
The algorithms have been initially described in: 

> S. Chester et al. 2016. "Top-k dominating queries, in parallel, in   
>   memory." Under review for: Proceedings of EDBT, 2 pages.


This software is based on the SkyBench suite, which was developed for
the following paper:

> S. Chester et al. 2015. "Scalable parallelization of skyline  
>   computation for multi-core processors." In: Proceedings of  
>   the 18th IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering  
>		(ICDE 2015), pp. 1083--1094.
>   doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICDE.2015.7113358


------------------------------------
### Requirements
<a name="requirements" ></a>

This software relies on the following packages/libraries:

 * OpenMP for parallelization
 * C++ 11 for newer programming features such as templates and auto types


------------------------------------
### Installation
<a name="installation" ></a>

To generate an executable, simply type `make all` from the root directory
of this package (the same directory in which you found this `README.md` file).
The makefile will generate the executable `bin/ParallelTKDQ`. If you 
encounter difficulties, try first typing `make deepclean` and ensure that
the `bin/` directory exists. You can run the executable from a terminal with 
no command line arguments to get usage instructions. 



------------------------------------
### Documentation
<a name="documentation" ></a>

The code has been documented for `doxygen`. If the `doc/html/` 
directory is empty or stale, you can regenerate the documentation 
by running `doxygen Doxyfile` from within the `doc/` subdirectory.
The `doxygen` settings are included in `doc/Doxyfile` and can be 
freely modified to suit your preferences.
